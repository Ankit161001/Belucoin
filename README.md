I have included all the steps needed to understand the entire process involved <br>
        in the functioning of a cryptocurrency. <br>
        The many functionalities included in the following code are :
        <ul>
        <li>Blockchain creation and updation 🔗</li> 
        <li>Mining and mining payment ⛏</li>
        <li>New user creation 🧑</li>
        <li>Purchasing Belucoins with actual cash 💸</li>
        <li>Selling Belucoins for actual cash 💰</li>
        <li>Maintaining cash balance in database 💳</li>
        <li>Adding cash to cash balance 💷</li>
        </ul>
<br>
The Jupyter Notebook contains all the details and reason behind every block of code. <br>
Check it out for better understanding.

<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> The <b>belucoin_database.db</b> is just provided for reference purposes. <br>
Just downloading the python notebook along with the jpg image will work just fine. <br>
Apon execution the code will create a database file by itself and place it in the current directory. <br>
So don't download the database file from the repository.
