Welcome to Belucoin. This is a complete cryptocurrency simulator.
<br>
I have included all the steps needed to understand the entire process involved <br>
        in the functioning of a cryptocurrency. <br><br>  
        The many functionalities included in the following code are :
        <ul>
        <li>Blockchain creation and updation 🔗</li> 
        <li>Mining and mining payment ⛏</li>
        <li>New user creation 🧑</li>
        <li>Purchasing Belucoins with actual cash 💸</li>
        <li>Selling Belucoins for actual cash 💰</li>
        <li>Maintaining cash balance in database 💳</li>
        <li>Adding cash to cash balance 💷</li>
        </ul>

The Jupyter Notebook contains all the details and reason behind every block of code. <br>
